          <strong>June 12, 1898 — Philippine Independence Declared</strong><br><br>
          General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed the independence of the Philippines from Spain in Kawit, Cavite. 
          The Philippine flag was unfurled and the national anthem was played publicly for the first time.

        <p>
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he journey toward freedom was long and arduous. After centuries under Spanish rule and then shifting to 
        American control following the 1898 Treaty of Paris, Filipinos began to organize politically to reclaim 
        their nation. The early 1900s saw leaders like Manuel Quezon, Sergio Osmeña, and others rise as champions 
        of self-rule.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Philippine Organic Act of 1902 established a Philippine Assembly, the first elected body where Filipinos 
        could legislate, though under American oversight. In 1916, the Jones Law promised eventual independence and 
        created a fully elected Philippine Legislature, galvanizing the nationalist movement.
        </p>

        <p>
        I walked Manila’s streets during these years, hearing the fervor in speeches and debates that echoed through 
        newly built halls of governance. Political parties like the Nacionalista Party emerged, pushing for autonomy
        while navigating the delicate relationship with the United States.
        </p>

        <p>
        The 1934 Tydings-McDuffie Act was a pivotal moment as it laid out a 10-year Commonwealth period as a transition 
        to full sovereignty. The following year, the Philippine Commonwealth was inaugurated with Manuel Quezon as 
        president, a symbol of hope and Filipino aspiration. Yet the path ahead was uncertain, marked by the challenge 
        of nation-building amid global turmoil.

        <p>
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he Commonwealth era was a period of ambitious reforms and cultural revival. Established in 1935, the new 
        government sought to prepare the Philippines for full independence by strengthening its political institutions, 
        economy, and society.
        </p>

        <p>
        President Manuel Quezon championed social justice, land reform, and the promotion of the Filipino language 
        to foster unity among diverse ethnic groups. Educational reforms expanded access and emphasized Filipino heritage. 
        Infrastructure projects modernized cities and connected provinces.
        </p>

        <p>
        But the dream was soon overshadowed by the clouds of World War II. In December 1941, the Japanese invasion 
        shattered the Commonwealth’s progress. Manila was declared an open city but still suffered intense bombings 
        and occupation.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Commonwealth government retreated into exile in the United States, where Quezon and later Sergio Osmeña 
        worked tirelessly to maintain Filipino legitimacy and garner Allied support. Meanwhile, Filipinos endured 
        brutal occupation, with resistance fighters rising across the archipelago.
        </p>

        <p>
        Despite the interruption, the Commonwealth period laid critical foundations for governance, identity, and 
        independence that would be reclaimed after the war.

        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he scars of war were everywhere. Manila was one of the most devastated cities in Asia, reduced to rubble 
        after the Battle of Manila in 1945. Millions of Filipinos faced displacement, hunger, and the challenge of 
        rebuilding a shattered nation.
        </p>

        <p>
        On July 4, 1946, the Philippines was finally recognized as an independent republic under the Treaty of Manila, 
        ending nearly 50 years of American sovereignty. I stood amidst the jubilant crowds at the inauguration, 
        witnessing a nation reclaim its future.
        </p>

        <p>
        Reconstruction was a colossal task. The government focused on rebuilding infrastructure, revitalizing agriculture, 
        and rehabilitating war refugees. The United States provided aid through the Bell Trade Act and the Philippine 
        Rehabilitation Act, though these came with economic strings attached.
        </p>

        <p>
        Political leaders worked to implement land reform and expand education, but challenges like poverty, insurgency, 
        and economic dependency persisted. Still, the Filipino people’s resilience was undeniable.
        </p>

        <p>
        The postwar years were both hopeful and complex which was a time of renewal, where independence was no longer a dream 
        but a demanding reality to be shaped by the sacrifices and vision of those who endured.
