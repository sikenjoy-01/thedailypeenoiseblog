          <strong>June 12, 1898 — Philippine Independence Declared</strong><br><br>
          General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed the independence of the Philippines from Spain in Kawit, Cavite. 
          The Philippine flag was unfurled and the national anthem was played publicly for the first time.

      <p>
        <span class="dropcap">T</span>he history of the Philippines is a complex blend of cultures, sovereignties, and aspirations. Prior to foreign rule, the archipelago 
        thrived with its own social structures—barangay communities led by datus, flourishing trade networks with China and the Malay world, 
        and belief systems deeply rooted in nature and ancestry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1521, the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan marked the beginning of Spanish interest in the islands. 
        By 1565, Spain formally established its rule under Miguel López de Legazpi, giving rise to more than 300 years of Spanish colonization. 
        This era shaped much of the Philippines’ religious and cultural foundation, from the spread of Catholicism to the construction of towns 
        centered around the church and plaza.      
      </p>
      <p>
        The American occupation followed the Spanish defeat in 1898, introducing public education, governance reforms, and new economic systems. 
        While framed as “benevolent assimilation,” this period also witnessed armed resistance, including the Philippine-American War, 
        which claimed the lives of thousands of Filipinos.
      </p>
      <p>
        World War II brought yet another foreign power, the Japanese. From 1941 to 1945, the country endured a period marked by hardship, violence, 
        and the bravery of guerrilla fighters who resisted occupation. With Japan’s surrender in 1945, the Philippines moved closer to the independence it long sought.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, on July 4, 1946, the Philippines was formally recognized as an independent nation. The journey toward sovereignty was not simply a timeline of colonizers, 
        but a testament to Filipino resilience, identity formation, and the continuing struggle for freedom and self-determination.
